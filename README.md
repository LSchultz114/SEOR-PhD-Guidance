# Guide to George Mason University SEOR PhD Program

A general review of what you need to know and what/when forms need to be done

## First Semester
### Classes

At the time I did it, these 4 standard classes are what you will be tested on in your Qualification Exam:

* SYST 505: Systems Engineering Principles
* SYST 520: System Engineering Design
* OR 541: Operations Research: Deterministic Models
* OR 542: Operations Research: Stochastic Models

Check the 'additional coursework requirements' tab to find exact ones at [SEOR Phd requirements](https://catalog.gmu.edu/colleges-schools/engineering-computing/engineering/systems-operations-research/systems-engineering-operations-research-phd/#requirementstext)

* **if you do not have a masters**, sign up for at least 3 of the 4 classes (remaining be done in second semester) if you are full-time
* **if you have a masters but it has been a while**, sign up for whatever class you need to review; alternatively, audit the class instead
* **if you have a masters and think your gold**, skip these 4

### Tasks
* Get an official transcript of all college schooling and save it--  you'll need it for a lot of stuff

* Email the SEOR office administrator and get the most up-to-date list of class requirements and options

   **suggestion:** fill in your tentative plans in the [Plan of Study Form](https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/bbcswebdav/orgs/AU_Volgenau_SEOR/PhD%20Forms%202021/SEOR%20PHD%20-%20Plan%20of%20study%20new.pdf) since you have to do it later anyway

* Start paying attention to what classes you like and what classes you don't
  
  _**You are assigned a default advisor based on your application but they do NOT have to stay that way**_
  
  If you like another professor or find their research interesting/more in line with your general area of interest, politely ask if you can become their phd student and, If they agree, they can help you with notifying your default advisor

  I know it's uncomfortable but the alternative is you have an advisor who cannot help you!

   _**You are doing this for 4 years!!! Don't make it miserable by ignoring this option!!!**_


## Qualifiers

Do this immediately after you have taken the standard 4 classes or reviewed the material well enough!!! You'll do fine if you've taken the 4 classes; general feedback is that this is medium difficulty 

### Forms

Form: [Request Form for Qualifying Exams](https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/bbcswebdav/orgs/AU_Volgenau_SEOR/PhD%20Forms%202021/Request%20Form%20for%20Qualifying%20Exams.pdf)
 **due 2 months __before__** you take the exam

### General 
* Must be done within 2 years of starting
* Is given in classroom 2 times a year: **August** and **January**
* Is over the course of a week
* You get 2 attempts
* OR ones allow you to bring calculator, notes and books but SYST ones don't

## Subsequent Semesters of Classes

Think about what your dissertation will be about

**Key I wish I'd known:** Your thesis does not have to revolutionize OR, guys--just contribute meaningfully. Applying OR techniques to real world problems in a different field (civil, biology, etc.)  **can be** a thesis

### Begin Researching
* pick an area (stochastic optimization)  or pick a field (transportation)
* Read papers and books
   * Go to Google Scholar and typing in your topic, pick the top cited paper as these tend to be foundational goldmines
   * If you find a paper about your problem/interest, consider 
      a. Going down its citations to find additional, useful papers
      b. Reading the 'further research needed' portion of the conclusion
* Visit conferences and see what the talks are about, etc.
      
   **This is building the first chapter of your thesis** (Literature Review)
   
* Keep track of/write up what you've read, what the main idea is, how it's useful to you: 
   * Is it basic history of the field/problem?
   * Is it how the technique works?
   * Is it an application related to what you are doing?
   * Is it a comparable technique or summary of alternatives? (you want to show why the technique you picked is the right one)

### Suggested Downloads
* Reference software like Zotero for keeping references 
* Learn software that makes formula writing much easier than word like TeXstudio/LaTeX
* Visual Studio Code is a wonderful (and free) interface software that lets you open everything from python code to latex and github
* Get a github account and start storing your codes there

4. Get copies of these from SEOR office administrator after it is signed by department and dean as you need it for candidacy

5. From here until Proposal, you email the SEOR office administrator to have her create a 'class' for dissertation proposal (SEOR998)

6. Build Committee

## Committee

   * 2 additional members must be from SEOR
   * 1 additional member must be from another school at GMU 
      
## Forms

## To Do List

1. Discuss and confirm your choices with your committee chair

2. Request meetings with the professors and ask if they will be on your committee (they will likely ask about what your tentative thesis topic is)

   Also, ask if they have any advice moving forward because they've done this and they can help! (that's what they are there for)

3. [Complete Advisory Committee form](https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/bbcswebdav/orgs/AU_Volgenau_SEOR/PhD%20Forms%202021/SEOR%20PhD_%20Advisory%20Committe%20Form.docx)

4. Begin setting up Comprehensives

## Comprehensive Exams

Consists of 2 parts:
  * Written
  * Oral
  
Oral must be completed within 30 days of the written portion

### Forms

### To Do List
  
1. Discuss with your committee chair the 4 courses you want to be tested on
   * At least 2 must be PhD classes
   * Must be relevant classes to your dissertation topic
   * Typically 2-3 questions per class is given
   * They usually are but are not required to be classes from your committee (since they are related to your topic already)
   
2. Talk with the teachers of your 4 classes
   * Do they want to do a take-home exam or a in-class exam?
   * When can they provide the questions?
   * What dates should you do the written and the oral? (do not schedule either of these less than 2 weeks out)
   
      I used suvey monkey and gave them several options to pick the best for them at their convienence
      If you can, combine your oral and proposal presentation (see proposal section if you do)

3. Complete [Permission to take Comprehensive Examination Form](https://mymasonportal.gmu.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-12965307-dt-content-rid-212150112_1/xid-212150112_1) at least 10 days before written exam

  * Chapter 2 covers: Literature Review 
      * Start general and narrow down, such as optimization->categories of optimization->specific algorithms
      * There are sooooo many thesis on the internet as they all get published. You don't know where to start? Google your topic/technique + 'thesis' and see how they organized their reviews
      
  * Last Chapter: Conclusion
  
  * **optional** Chapter 3-? covers: if you have more, such as you wrote a paper, put it in here. Doesn't hurt
   
### To Do List
